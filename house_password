# Stephan and Sophia forget about security and use simple passwords for everything. 
# Help Nikola develop a password security check module. 
# The password will be considered strong enough if its length is greater than or equal to 10 symbols,  
# it has at least one digit, as well as containing one uppercase letter and one lowercase letter in it.  
# The password contains only ASCII latin letters or digits. 
#  
# Input: A password as a string. 
# Output: Is the password safe or not as a boolean or any data type that can be  
# converted and processed as a boolean. In the results you will see the converted results.
